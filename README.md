by Xin Li, Fan Yang, Hong Cheng, Wei Liu and Dinggang Shen

### Introduction

This repository is for '[Contour Knowledge Transfer for Salient ObjectDetection](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Xin_Li_Contour_Knowledge_Transfer_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf)'.
### Installation

For installation, please follow the instructions of [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe).

The code has been tested successfully on Ubuntu 14.04 with CUDA 8.0.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/lixin666/C2SNet.git
   ```

2. Build Caffe and pycaffe:

   ```shell
   cd caffe-master
   cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
   vim Makefile.config
   make -j8 && make pycaffe
   ```
ps: You should uncomment 'WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1' in Makefile.config before compiling.


3. Test:

   - Test code is in folder 'code'.
   
    - We provide two models trained with 10K (MSRA10K) and 30K (MSRA10K + Web Images) training images. Download trained models and put them in folder 'code/models':

   - Put the test images in folder 'images', and run
   
   ```shell
   python run_demo.py
   ```
   -After that, the results will be genrated in folder 'res'.
   
4. Results:
  - You can also download the results for comparison.
